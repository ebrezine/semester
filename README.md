# CS491 Semester Project

## Authors
* Elias Brezine
* Erik Marsh

## Notes

1. We could not both get access to our GitHub classroom repositories, so we had to create a general repository.
2. Since this is forked from our In-Class Exercise assignment, the database has the same name. Just in case, drop the database (`ecto.drop`) before running the project.
